  "subject": "Building durable contributions for your S-STEM scholars",
  "body": "Every cohort graduates and the next one relearns the same analysis workflows.\n\nI built Ouro to help training programs like yours let students publish reusable computational tools - so their work has a visible shelf life beyond the degree. When another lab uses their method, your scholar's name and your mentoring lineage travel with it.\n\nWould this kind of durable contribution resonate for your S-STEM cohorts?\n\nHappy to chat after the holidays.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
