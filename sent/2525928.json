  "body": "Hi Lindsey,\n\nWith BIO-PREP focused on building technical skillsets and industry readiness for biotech careers, I imagine you're fielding a fair amount of requests—students asking for scripts, employers wanting to see curriculum materials, other programs looking to replicate what you've built.\n\nOuro provides a thin API layer over computational workflows, letting other researchers reuse methods directly instead of recreating them from papers. It's a way to consolidate the work you're already doing—sharing code, answering emails, digging up old materials—into a single durable endpoint.\n\nWith winter break coming up, I'll keep this brief. Happy to give you a quick peek if it's useful.\n\nHappy holidays,\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
