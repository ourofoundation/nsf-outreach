  "body": "Hey Jongwan,\n\nI'm a computational materials scientist who keeps running into the same problem: models and simulations that work great for a paper basically evaporate after publication.\n\nBuilt something called Ouro to fix this—it's infrastructure that turns published computational methods into things other researchers can actually call and reuse without reverse-engineering your code.\n\nFigured this might resonate if you've done any modeling work on frozen soil dynamics. Happy to share more if you're curious.\n\nHope you're having a good holiday season.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
