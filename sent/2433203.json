  "body": "Hi Christopher,\n\nI've been following your work on discovering new chalcogenide semiconductors, and I really appreciate the effort to bridge the gap between what's computationally promising and what's actually possible to synthesize. That's genuinely hard science.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a platform for sharing computational tools and datasets in a way that's actually usable—not just a zip file buried in supplementary materials. I thought it might resonate with what you're doing, especially the computational-experimental feedback loop.\n\nWould love to hear if this could be useful for your group.\n\nThanks,",
