  "body": "Hi Allison,\n\nYour lab's work on collision physics with ML sounds like it's producing some really useful computational models. Here's the thing—when that code and those neural networks live in a paper's appendix, your students' contributions kind of disappear with it.\n\nOuro helps you publish working tools so they actually get used elsewhere. When someone applies your models to a new problem, your trainees get credit and visibility for the real impact they built.\n\nWorth a quick conversation?\n\nBest,\nMatt\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
