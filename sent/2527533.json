  "subject": "Make your methods reusable once, not per email",
  "body": "Publishing ML methods that ecologists want to use probably means you're fielding \"how do I run this on my data?\" emails.\n\nI built Ouro to consolidate that into a single API. Other researchers call your method directly instead of recreating it. Document once, they reuse forever.\n\nHappy to show you how it works. Heads up—I'm off Dec 23-Jan 2 if you'd rather connect in January.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
