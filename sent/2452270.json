  "body": "Hi Michael,\n\nBet you've gotten at least a few \"can you share your ODMR analysis code?\" emails. Or had to explain the same processing pipeline twice.\n\nI built Ouro to turn that into a single API endpoint. It's a thin layer over computational methods that lets other researchers call your workflow directly instead of recreating it. Consolidates what you're already doing—sharing scripts, answering methodology questions—into something durable.\n\nWorth a quick call? No rush with the holidays, but happy to show you how it works.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
