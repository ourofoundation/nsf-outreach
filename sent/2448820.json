  "subject": "Re: sharing enzyme design models across HMO work",
  "body": "Hi James,\n\nI've been thinking about projects using AlphaFold/RFDiffusion for glycosyltransferase engineering—there's this recurring tension between generating useful design insights and making those models reusable beyond the original paper.\n\nYour work on cell-free HMO synthesis seems like it'll produce datasets and workflows that could be valuable infrastructure for others working on glycosylation enzymes.\n\nThat's what led me to Ouro—it's a way to make computational work discoverable, reusable, and citable, so methods live on as infrastructure, not just text in a methods section.\n\nI can set up access for your lab if you want to take a glance.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt\nFounder\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
