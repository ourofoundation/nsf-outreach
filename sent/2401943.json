  "subject": "Your ML models for ferro-nanofluids",
  "body": "Hi Professor Shafiee,\n\nI came across your work on using machine learning to predict how magnetic fields affect nanofluid properties. That's a cool intersection of experimental data and predictive modeling.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a platform where researchers publish their computational workflows as APIs. Instead of others re-implementing your models from a paper, they can just call them directly through Python.\n\nWould a quick call make sense to explore if this fits what you're doing?\n\nBest,",
