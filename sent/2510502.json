  "body": "Hi Anton,\n\nI'm Matt, building Ouro. Your work on particle behavior in plasma afterglow caught my attention—especially the simulations piece.\n\nHere's the thing: good computational methods usually stay locked in papers. Other groups end up rebuilding from scratch instead of reusing what you've already figured out. It's wasteful, and hard to demonstrate real uptake.\n\nOuro wraps computational workflows in a simple API so other researchers can actually use your methods directly. Turns your work into a building block.\n\nCurious if this resonates for your simulations? Happy to chat.\n\nBest,\nMatt\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
