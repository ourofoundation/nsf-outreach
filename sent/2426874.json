  "body": "Hi Professor Seo,\n\nI came across your NSF work on stacking rhodium and iridium oxides to unlock new quantum properties. Sounds like you're using a bunch of advanced spectroscopy techniques—RAMAN, X-ray scattering—to understand what's happening at those interfaces.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a platform for sharing computational tools and datasets in a way that actually works, not just scattered files.\n\nWould be curious if this could help your group.\n\nBest,",
