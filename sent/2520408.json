  "body": "Hi Gregory,\n\nI've been thinking about image segmentation models for measuring fruit traits—seems like the kind of method other breeding programs would want to use, but reimplementing from a paper is a pain.\n\nI'm building Ouro to turn published computational methods into callable tools that people can actually reuse without starting from scratch. Keeps seeing the same pattern: good methods that never leave the lab that made them.\n\nWould you be up for a quick chat about this in January?\n\nHope you have a great holiday.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
