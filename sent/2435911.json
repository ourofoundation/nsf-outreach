  "subject": "Getting proper credit for your computational work",
  "body": "Hi Ju,\n\nI came across your work on accelerating materials discovery with machine learning and physics constraints—really interesting stuff. I'm guessing your datasets and trained models are getting used by researchers downstream, but probably aren't getting cited or tracked properly.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a platform for sharing computational tools and datasets in a way that's actually usable, not just a zip file in supplementary materials. It handles the citations and tracking automatically.\n\nWould you be open to a quick chat?\n\nBest",
