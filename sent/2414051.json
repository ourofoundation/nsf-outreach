  "body": "Hey Ahmed,\n\nI came across your work combining point process theory with E-TEM data to understand how nanoparticles evolve—really cool stuff.\n\nI'm building Ouro, where researchers publish datasets and computational tools as APIs that others can actually use, not just read about in a methods section. Your group's work becomes discoverable and citable.\n\nI feel like your spatio-temporal models and segmentation pipelines are exactly the kind of thing that should be out there for others to build on.\n\nWould you be open to a quick chat?\n\nBest,",
