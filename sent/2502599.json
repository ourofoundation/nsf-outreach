  "subject": "Getting credit when others actually use your methods",
  "body": "Your students and collaborators probably recreate L-function moment calculations from your papers rather than reusing your actual implementations—dependency issues, cluster-specific setup, etc.\n\nI built Ouro to fix this: an API layer over computational workflows that lets others call your methods directly. You get credit through visible usage metrics, not just citations.\n\nWould you be open to a quick chat in January?\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
