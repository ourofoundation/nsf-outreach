  "body": "Hi Jiang,\n\nLabs doing AI accelerator work produce tools that could help dozens of other groups—but they usually die in a methods section.\n\nOuro lets you publish computational methods as actual infrastructure. When someone reuses a tool your student built, their name and your lab's connection travel with it. It's a way to make training contributions visible and durable.\n\nWorth a quick chat in January?\n\nHope you have a good holiday break.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
