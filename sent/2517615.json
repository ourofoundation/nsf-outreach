  "body": "Hi Daniel,\n\nReading about CIRCS, I found myself thinking about how much computational infrastructure sits behind work like this—ensemble forecasting, AI-based risk assessment, high-resolution weather prediction. These methods often get described in papers but rarely become something others can directly call and build on.\n\nI'm working on Ouro, a place where published computational methods become callable, reusable infrastructure—so others can build on your work without reimplementing it from scratch.\n\nGiven the industry-facing nature of CIRCS, I'm curious whether making your modeling tools more accessible to partners is something you've thought about.\n\nIf you're curious, I can show you how it works.\n\nHope winter break treats you well—happy holidays!\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
