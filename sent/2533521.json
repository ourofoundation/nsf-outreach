  "body": "Yuichiro,\n\nI know your pH measurement work involves a ton of computational effort. Here's what I've noticed: that code and those methods usually stay locked in the paper.\n\nOuro lets you package up your workflows and datasets as reusable blocks that other oceanographers can actually drop into their own projects. No rebuilding from scratch every time.\n\nWorth a quick conversation? Happy to chat through what this'd look like for your work.\n\nHope you're having a good holiday break.\n\nBest\nMatt\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
