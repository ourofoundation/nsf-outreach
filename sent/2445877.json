  "body": "Getting ML and data pipelines to work across 5 different institutions sounds like dependency hell on expert mode.\n\nI built Ouro after hitting the same wall—my computational stuff didn't outlive the paper. It's a way to package research code and data so it actually runs elsewhere, not just on your setup.\n\nWorth a quick chat? It's holiday season, so no rush.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
