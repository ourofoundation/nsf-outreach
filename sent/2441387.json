  "body": "Hey Andrew,\n\nBuilt Ouro because I kept hitting the same wall—publish the paper, park the code in a supplement, watch nobody actually reuse the framework. Just reimplement from scratch every time.\n\nIt's a platform where computational methods become callable infrastructure. Your stochastic modeling framework stays alive as something others can actually build on, not just read about.\n\nHappy to show you how it works if you're around after the holidays.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
