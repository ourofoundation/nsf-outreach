  "body": "Hi Dr. Bewersdorf,\n\nI came across your NSF project on ER nanomorphology and the peptide loading complex—interesting work bridging advanced imaging (DNA-PAINT, 4Pi-SMS) with structural biology.\n\nNSF increasingly expects computational methods to be accessible and reusable, but demonstrating that in practice is harder than checking a box on a data management plan. That's what we're working on with Ouro—a way to make computational work discoverable, reusable, and citable—so methods live on as infrastructure, not just text in a methods section.\n\nGiven the imaging and analysis pipelines involved in your work, this might be relevant.\n\nHappy to give you a quick peek if it's useful. And with winter break approaching, hope you have a restful holiday.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
