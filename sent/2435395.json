  "body": "Hi Fadi,\n\nI'm working on computational reproducibility in biophysics. Saw you're using deep learning methods for ferritin structure analysis—I've hit the same wall where publishing a computational method doesn't mean anyone can actually run it again.\n\nBuilt something called Ouro that might help. It provides a thin API layer over computational workflows, letting other researchers reuse methods directly instead of recreating them from papers.\n\nFigured it might be useful for the structural biology + ML parts of your iron homeostasis work.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to poke around.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt\nFounder\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
