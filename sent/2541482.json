  "body": "Derek—\n\nYour polarimetric work on massive stars involves some serious computational modeling, and I'm guessing that code lives mostly in papers and local drives.\n\nOuro wraps research workflows in a lightweight API so other astronomers can actually use what you've built instead of re-coding it from scratch. It's becoming an expectation that methods are reusable—we just make it easier to show you're delivering on that.\n\nWorth a quick call? And happy holidays.\n\nBest,\nMatt\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
