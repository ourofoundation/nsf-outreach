  "subject": "Making your ML work accessible beyond the paper",
  "body": "Hi Stratis,\n\nI came across your NSF work on robust ML for edge devices – it's exactly the kind of research that should be easy for others to actually use and build on, especially when you're reporting on broader impacts.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a platform for sharing computational tools and datasets in a way that's actually usable, not just a zip file in supplementary materials.\n\nFigured it might be helpful for making your work more accessible and demonstrating real-world use in grant reports.\n\nAny interest in trying it out?\n\nBest",
