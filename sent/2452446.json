  "subject": "Credit for computational methods in photocatalysis",
  "body": "Professor Frenkel,\n\nYour collaborative work on photocatalytic descriptors involves machine learning-assisted spectroscopic analysis—computational methods that often go uncited even when others build on them.\n\nOuro helps researchers share computational tools and datasets in a way that's actually usable and durable, rather than a zip file buried in supplementary materials. Citations capture acknowledgment, but not actual influence. Ouro makes computational work both citable and visibly used.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to poke around.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt\nFounder\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
