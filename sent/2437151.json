  "body": "Hi Michael,\n\nSimulation outputs too big for supplements, code that only runs on your cluster—NSF wants computational work reproducible, but most folks can't actually run a CFD parameter sweep even if they have the paper.\n\nBuilt Ouro to fix this: turns simulations and workflows into building blocks others can plug into their work without recreating your entire environment.\n\nHappy to show you. (No rush if you're heads-down before the holidays.)\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
