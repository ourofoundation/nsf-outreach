  "body": "Hi Dr. Young,\n\nI know you're heading into winter break soon—hope you get some actual downtime.\n\nI'm reaching out because between Nab's waveform analysis, machine learning work, and UCNτ+ simulations, you're likely already fielding requests for code, digging up old scripts, and answering the same technical questions multiple times.\n\nOuro helps researchers share computational tools and datasets in a way that's actually usable and durable, rather than a zip file buried in supplementary materials. It consolidates that work into a single endpoint so it's accessible without the back-and-forth.\n\nHappy to get your group a look if it's helpful.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
