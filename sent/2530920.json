  "subject": "Making climate emulator methods reusable (not just citable)",
  "body": "Hi Elizabeth,\n\nYour work on climate emulators and their ability to generalize beyond training data—especially the patch methodology for evaluating physics consistency—addresses a real gap in ML-climate research.\n\nOne challenge with computational methods like these: citations capture acknowledgment, but not actual influence. Someone might cite your emulator work without ever running it themselves.\n\nOuro provides a thin API layer over computational workflows, letting other researchers reuse methods directly instead of recreating them from papers. It makes computational contributions both citable and visibly used.\n\nIf you're curious, I can show you how it works.\n\nHope you get some rest over winter break—happy holidays!\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
