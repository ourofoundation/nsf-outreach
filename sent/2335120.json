  "subject": "Concrete durability + reproducible computational workflows",
  "body": "Hi Professor Suraneni,\n\nI came across your NSF project on making concrete more durable in freeze-thaw conditions. What stood out is how you're combining experimental work with molecular dynamics simulations—that's the kind of multiscale modeling work that's ripe for sharing.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a platform to publish computational workflows as APIs so other researchers can directly use your methods instead of just reading about them in papers. Wondering if a quick 15-minute call could be useful?\n\nBest,",
