  "subject": "Your metamaterial design tools should outlive the paper",
  "body": "Francis,\n\nYou're developing open-source design software for elastic metamaterials—tools that could actually get used in soft robotics, prosthetics, deployable structures. But most computational methods die with the paper.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a place to publish your computational workflows as APIs with a Python SDK so other researchers can call your methods directly. Your work becomes infrastructure others build on, not just a paper they cite.\n\nHappy to set you up with access if you want to poke around.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt\nFounder\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
