  "body": "Hi James,\n\nI came across your NSF work on discovering new chalcogenide semiconductors – really cool that you're tackling the synthesis bottleneck experimentally and computationally.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a platform for sharing computational tools and datasets in a way that's actually usable, not just a zip file in supplementary materials. For grant reports and broader impact statements, it makes demonstrating real-world use pretty straightforward.\n\nThought it might be worth exploring for your group. Would love to hear if this could be useful for you.\n\nBest",
