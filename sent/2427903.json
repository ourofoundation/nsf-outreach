  "body": "Hi Professor Burke,\n\nI've been following your work on using machine learning to improve density functional theory for materials simulation. It's a clever approach to making those accuracy-vs-speed tradeoffs less painful.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a platform that helps researchers share and discover computational work—workflows, datasets, notebooks—in ways that actually stick. Given how much you're developing new DFT methods for the broader community, I thought you might find it useful.\n\nOpen to a quick chat?\n\nBest,",
