  "subject": "Making health ML methods actually reusable",
  "body": "Hi Ritambhara,\n\nYou're building methods that integrate different types of health data—the kind of work that could be useful across lots of datasets and questions. But most computational methods get published and then just sit there. People cite them but rarely actually use them.\n\nI'm working on Ouro, a platform where published methods become callable infrastructure that others can build on without reimplementing everything. It makes reuse and accessibility easier to demonstrate, which NSF increasingly cares about.\n\nWorth a quick chat in January?\n\nHappy holidays,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
