  "subject": "Making computational methods reusable beyond the paper",
  "body": "Hi Wei,\n\nNSF increasingly expects computational work to be accessible and reusable, but that's hard to evidence in practice—especially for methods involving symmetry-preserving architectures and geometric deep learning.\n\nOuro provides a thin API layer over computational workflows, letting other researchers reuse methods directly instead of recreating them from papers. It makes demonstrating real-world accessibility simpler without major workflow changes.\n\nHappy to give you a quick peek if it's useful.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt\nFounder\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
