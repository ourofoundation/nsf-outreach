  "body": "Hi Ying,\n\nI was reading about your work on cellulose synthase trafficking and got curious about the machine learning piece—are you using it to track the exocytosis/endocytosis patterns in your live-cell imaging data?\n\nI'm working on Ouro, which helps researchers share computational work (workflows, datasets, notebooks) in a way that's actually reproducible and discoverable by others in your field.\n\nHappy to get your group set up if you want to see how it works.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt\nFounder\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
