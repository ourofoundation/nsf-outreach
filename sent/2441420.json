  "body": "Hi Professor Islam,\n\nI came across your work on magnesium-CO2 batteries and the computational modeling you're doing around interfacial chemistry. That's a fascinating approach to next-gen energy storage.\n\nI'm working on Ouro, a platform that helps researchers like you share computational workflows, datasets, and results in a way that's reproducible and discoverable by collaborators. Given the scale of simulations you're running (DFT, MD, ML), thought it might be useful.\n\nWorth a quick conversation?\n\nBest,",
