  "body": "Hi Tim,\n\nI'm reaching out as we head into winter break—hope you have a good holiday.\n\nI work on tools for research labs developing new catalytic methods. One thing I've noticed: when your trainees publish computational workflows or protocols, those contributions can travel with their names as others reuse them across different labs.\n\nOuro provides a thin API layer over computational workflows, letting other researchers reuse methods directly instead of recreating them from papers.\n\nIt might be useful for your group as you develop new C-H functionalization protocols and train students through those collaborations you mentioned.\n\nHappy to get your group a look if it's helpful.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
