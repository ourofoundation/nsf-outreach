  "body": "Hi Peng,\n\nI've been following your work on machine learning for nanoporous materials—exciting stuff on the material discovery side. I'm curious about the flip side though: when your students and postdocs build these tools, how are they sharing them with other labs?\n\nI'm building Ouro, a platform for sharing computational tools and datasets in a way that's actually usable, not just a zip file in supplementary materials. The idea is students get real career visibility when their work gets adopted elsewhere—that's a powerful asset before they hit the job market.\n\nWould you be open to a quick chat?\n\nBest",
