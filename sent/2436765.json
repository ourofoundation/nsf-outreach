  "subject": "Making your teaching code reusable without the email burden",
  "body": "Hi Li,\n\nYou're building pathways for students to learn data science across disciplines—which means you're probably sharing a lot of code, notebooks, and methods.\n\nI'm working on Ouro, a place where computational methods become callable endpoints. Instead of re-sharing scripts or answering \"how do I run this?\" emails, your work becomes infrastructure others can just use.\n\nIt consolidates what you're already doing—making your teaching materials accessible—into something durable.\n\nWorth a quick chat? I know it's the holiday season, so no rush.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
