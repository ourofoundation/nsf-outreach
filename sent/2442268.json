  "body": "Image analysis pipelines for characterization data are impossible to share well. Too custom, too many dependencies, outputs too big for SI.\n\nI built Ouro as a thin API over computational workflows—lets other researchers rerun your methods directly instead of reimplementing from the paper. Makes NSF's accessibility expectations actually manageable.\n\nQuick demo after holidays if you're curious?\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
