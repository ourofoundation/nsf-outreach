  "body": "Hi Professor Min,\n\nI saw your NSF project on machining ceramics like sapphire and understanding how defects affect the process. What caught my attention is how much trial-and-error currently goes into optimizing these parameters—seems like the kind of work where sharing reproducible models and simulation code could save your colleagues a lot of time.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a platform where researchers publish working tools—scripts, simulations, datasets—that others can reuse directly. Less recreating methods from papers, more actual science.\n\nWould be curious if this resonates for your group.\n\nBest,",
