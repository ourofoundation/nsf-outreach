  "subject": "Getting credit when others use your adversarial techniques",
  "body": "Adversarial ML work needs to be reproducible to have impact, but sharing trained models and attack code that others can actually run is a mess.\n\nI built Ouro to help researchers share computational stuff (models, code, environments) in a way that's durable and usable, not just a GitHub link that breaks in six months. Citations matter, but so does making your techniques actually usable.\n\nWorth a quick chat? I know it's heading into the holidays, so January works too.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
