  "body": "Hi Dr. Wang,\n\nI'm reaching out to researchers working in quantum information and spin-mechanical systems. Given the complexity of diamond spin-mechanics experiments—GHz Lamb wave resonators, phononic crystal designs, spin-qubit coupling analysis—I imagine there's a fair amount of computational work that accumulates and gets asked about.\n\nOuro helps researchers share computational tools and datasets in a way that's actually usable and durable, rather than a zip file buried in supplementary materials. It consolidates the work you're already doing—sharing code, answering emails about methods, digging up old scripts—into a single endpoint that lasts.\n\nHappy to get your group a look if it's helpful.\n\nHope winter break gives you some downtime. Happy holidays.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
