  "subject": "Image analysis other labs can run",
  "body": "Imaging pipelines are a nightmare to share. Someone tries your analysis, dependencies break, preprocessing steps aren't clear, they give up.\n\nI built Ouro as a thin API over computational workflows—other researchers call your methods directly instead of rebuilding from your paper.\n\nHappy to show you how it works. No rush with the holidays.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
