  "body": "Hi Yixin,\n\nYou're doing great work on generative models for weather data—and you'll probably end up fielding a lot of follow-up emails asking for code, or fielding requests to run it on new datasets.\n\nOuro lets you turn that into a single callable endpoint. Once it's up, researchers just hit an API instead of emailing you. Your methods stay accessible, you stay sane.\n\nWorth a quick conversation?\n\nBest,\nMatt\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
