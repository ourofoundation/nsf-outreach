  "subject": "Making verification toolchains actually reusable",
  "body": "Getting your verification tools and proof systems to run on someone else's machine is... optimistic. Too many dependencies, version issues, setup steps that never get fully documented.\n\nBuilt Ouro as a thin API layer over computational workflows - researchers reuse methods directly instead of recreating from papers. Makes accessibility and real-world reuse easier to demonstrate.\n\nHappy to show you if interested. (No rush - holidays aren't for thinking about reproducibility.)\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
