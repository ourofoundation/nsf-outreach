  "subject": "Your grad students' biosensor work",
  "body": "Hi Ryan,\n\nI saw your work on portable biosensors for toxin detection and thought about the students and postdocs building the AI/ML models and testing protocols in your lab.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a platform for sharing computational tools and datasets in a way that's actually usable, not just a zip file in supplementary materials.\n\nWhen your students publish tools that other labs can actually use, it becomes a real career asset—something concrete they can point to on the job market.\n\nWould a 15-minute call be useful to see if it fits your workflow?\n\nBest,\n\nMatt\nFounder\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
