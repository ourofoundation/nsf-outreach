  "subject": "Smart textiles assembly + a tool for sharing your work",
  "body": "Hi Professor Li,\n\nI came across your NSF project on water-based coatings for smart textiles. I love that you're tackling the challenge of getting different materials to stick together without harsh chemical treatments—just salt and smart assembly. That's elegant.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a platform for sharing computational tools and datasets in a way that's actually usable, not just a zip file buried in supplementary materials.\n\nCurious if it might be useful for your team?\n\nBest,",
