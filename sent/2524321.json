  "body": "Hi David,\n\nYour work on scaling Learning Assistants and the Pedagogy Academy across departments involves a lot of moving pieces—training materials, data tracking, resources that need to be accessible to faculty across different units.\n\nOuro helps researchers share computational tools and datasets in a way that's actually usable and durable, rather than a zip file buried in supplementary materials. It could give you a single place to house the scripts, surveys, and documentation your team is already producing, without the usual back-and-forth of emailing files or digging through old folders.\n\nI can set up access for your lab if you want to take a glance.\n\nHope you get some rest over winter break—happy holidays.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
