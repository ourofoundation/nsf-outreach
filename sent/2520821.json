  "subject": "fMRI analysis pipelines that run elsewhere",
  "body": "Analysis pipelines combining fMRI, eye tracking, and behavioral data rarely work outside the lab that built them. Dependency issues, preprocessing quirks, environment-specific paths.\n\nBuilt Ouro to make computational methods actually reusable and citable—not just described in a methods section.\n\nHappy to show you how it works. Heading into the holidays but around if you want to chat.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
