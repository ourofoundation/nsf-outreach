  "body": "Hi Xiaolei,\n\nI saw your CAREER award on temporal learning for healthcare ML. As you're training the next generation in this space, I thought Ouro might be useful for your group.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a place to publish your computational workflows as APIs with a Python SDK so other researchers can call your methods directly. Your work becomes infrastructure others build on, not just a paper they cite.\n\nFor grad students and postdocs, having their tools used by other labs is a real career asset—builds their reputation before the job market.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to take it for a spin.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt\nFounder\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
