  "body": "Hi Brandi,\n\nI came across your work on magic-sized clusters and nanocrystals at UW. With all the synthesis methods and cluster-to-nanocrystal conversion data you're generating, I imagine you get the occasional \"code available upon request\" email.\n\nI'm working on Ouro, which helps researchers share computational work (workflows, datasets, notebooks) in a way that's actually reproducible and discoverable by others in your field. Put it up once, point people there forever.\n\nWould you be open to a quick chat?\n\nBest",
