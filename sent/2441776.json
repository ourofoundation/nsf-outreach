  "body": "Hi Milan,\n\nNSF's getting serious about public access, but it's tough to show that anyone's actually using what you share—especially computational stuff that isn't just a zip file somewhere.\n\nI work with Ouro. We help researchers package and share code and data in a way that's genuinely usable and trackable. Makes it easier to demonstrate real-world reuse when that matters.\n\nFigured it might be relevant for your imaging analysis or modeling work, or folks you collaborate with.\n\nHappy to chat briefly if useful. Hope you have a good holiday season.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
