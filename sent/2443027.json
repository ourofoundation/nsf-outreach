  "subject": "Thanks for mapping the materials landscape",
  "body": "Hi Stefano,\n\nI've been following your work on counting and sampling material structures—it's the kind of fundamental question that makes computational science exciting.\n\nI'm building Ouro, a platform for sharing computational tools and datasets in a way that's actually usable, not just a zip file in supplementary materials.\n\nGiven how much your work bridges materials discovery and method development, I thought it might resonate. Would love to hear if this could be useful for your group.\n\nThanks",
