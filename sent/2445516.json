  "subject": "Making REU research outputs easier to share",
  "body": "Hi Dr. Vohra,\n\nYour REU program is doing impressive work—getting undergrads hands-on with materials research and national lab facilities. I imagine grant reporting on accessibility and impact is always top of mind.\n\nI'm working on Ouro, which helps researchers share computational work (workflows, datasets, notebooks) in a way that's actually reproducible and discoverable by others in your field. It's designed to make demonstrating real-world use straightforward for NSF reports.\n\nWould a 15-minute call be useful to see if it fits your workflow?\n\nBest",
