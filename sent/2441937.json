  "subject": "Making quantitative models reusable",
  "body": "Estimation pipelines with multiple stages—data construction, calibration, counterfactuals—rarely get reused. Others can't easily reproduce your workflow or build on your estimated parameters.\n\nI built Ouro as a thin API over computational work so researchers can call your methods directly instead of fighting with replication packages.\n\nWorth a quick chat? Taking a break for holidays, so no rush.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
