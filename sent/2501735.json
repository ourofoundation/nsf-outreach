Nightmare.\n\nI'm a computational materials scientist who built Ouro because I kept hitting the same wall—my coupling frameworks and workflows didn't outlive the paper. It's a tool for sharing computational work in a way that's actually reproducible, not just a zip file with a prayer.\n\nHappy to show you a quick demo after the holidays if you're interested.\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
