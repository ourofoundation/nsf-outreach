  "award_title": "Collaborative Research: NeTS: Medium: Resilient Multi-User Mobile sub-THz Networks using Near-Field Wavefronts",
  "award_amount": 300000,
  "subject": "Getting credit when people actually use your simulation code",
  "body": "Simulation outputs from near-field propagation models get massive fast, and sharing them across collaborating institutions usually means Dropbox links that die or \"just run it yourself\" (if the cluster configs match).\n\nOuro's a platform we built so researchers can share computational tools and datasets in a way that's actually usable long-term—not zip files in supplementary materials. Others can cite your work AND you see when they actually use it.\n\nWorth a quick call after the holidays?\n\nBest,\n\nMatt Moderwell\nhttps://ouro.foundation",
