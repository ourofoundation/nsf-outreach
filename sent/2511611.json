  "body": "You're updating COMET for others to use, but we both know most researchers will cite the paper and rebuild from scratch anyway. Setup is always the wall.\n\nI'm a computational materials scientist—built Ouro as an API layer over workflows so people can just call your method instead of recreating it.
