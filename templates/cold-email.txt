Subject: Your [specific research topic] work + a platform that might help

Hi Professor [LastName],

I came across your NSF project on [specific topic from their abstract]. [One specific detail that shows you read the abstract - a method, material, or goal they mentioned].

I'm building Ouro - a platform where researchers can publish and discover computational workflows, datasets, and analysis tools. We make it easy to share reproducible research and find relevant work from others in your field.

Given your work on [specific aspect of their research], thought it might be useful for your group.

Would you be open to a quick chat?

Best,
