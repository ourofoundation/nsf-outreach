Two-dimensional systems—such as quantum wells, graphene monolayers and multilayers, topological insulators, and twisted bilayers—form a vibrant subfield of condensed matter physics. Many of the central ideas in this field trace back to the phenomena of the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, which revealed new states of matter governed by emergent particles.\r\n\r\nA striking feature of the fractional quantum Hall effect is the emergence of anyons—quasiparticles that obey fractional statistics. These are of deep theoretical interest and are also central to certain ideas for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Recent discoveries of fractional quantum Hall-like states at zero magnetic field in twisted semiconductor and graphene multilayers mark a major advance, potentially enabling more accessible platforms for realizing anyons.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to undertake a quantitative theoretical study of the properties of anyons in these systems. The goals include: (i) Molecular anyons:  The PI and his team will explore the possibility of whether the abelian and non-Abelian anyons tend to cluster together to form molecules, and if so, how the charge of the molecule depends on the interaction between the electrons. Such molecular anyons may explain the anomalous charge measured in shot noise experiments and will have many implications for future experiments. (ii) Photoluminescence Theory: A framework will be developed to assess whether photoluminescence studies of fractional quantum Hall effect can serve as a probe of anyonic excitations and their bound states. (iii) Composite Fermion Pairing:  Non-Abelian anyons are excitations of paired states of composite fermions. PI and his collaborators have shown that pairing of composite fermions can be induced by going to a higher Landau level, by increasing the width, or by enhancing Landau level mixing. They will investigate whether pairing of composite fermions can also be induced by proximity coupling to a superconductor or by screening the interaction by nearby metallic layer.  Implementation of a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type superconductivity of composite fermions in the spherical geometry will be sought.  (iv) Wave Functions for Twisted Bilayers: Variational wave functions for composite fermions will be constructed to describe fractional quantum Hall states in twisted bilayer systems. \r\n\r\nThe project will use a combination of exact diagonalization, variational methods, quantum Monte Carlo (including fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo), and field theoretical and mean-field approaches.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
